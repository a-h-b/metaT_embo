Welcome to the metaT hands-on!
==============================

The analysis of metatranscriptomes shares much of its concepts and techniques with metagenomics. In this session, you have the chance to compare the two omics levels at the whole-community level and at the level of a MAG. 

Going through the parts under the 'Sections' header, you can perform some analyses on the HPC. The 'Processing steps' header holds example rules for handling metaT data. They are too slow to run with any fun during the course - we've prepared the data for you using these methods.
